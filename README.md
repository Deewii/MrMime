# MrMime - pgoapi Abstraction

MrMime is an abstraction library for pgoapi. It provides a `POGOAccount` object which allows you
to easily log in to an account and perform various requests. You don't have to take care of proper login
sequence, constructing the right requests and even parsing some of the responses yourself.
